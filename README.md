# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
##The project used the PTB diagnostic ECG database from Physionet to develop and test machine learning algorithms for the classification of healthy and unhealthy patients. The study focused on four commonly used algorithms, including logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision tree, and random forest. The dataset used in the study was imbalanced, with significantly more unhealthy patients than healthy patients.
The classification accuracy of each algorithm was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation and ADASYN, an oversampling technique used to address the issue of imbalanced datasets.
